Setting up env for use (has all required packages for DEMOGORGN-web and sgs_topography)

1: enable conda by doing either (forgot how exactly I did it since it was a little bit ago)
	a. module load conda
	b. sftp miniconda or conda binary into hipergator and use bash
2: after install/activation, do "conda env create --file d.yml"
